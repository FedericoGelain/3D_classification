# 3D_classification
This projects aims to develop deep learning models that are able to classify 3D objects, provided as 3D meshes, exploring different representations and comparing them in terms of performance and accuracy. Currently, the implementations are the following:
<ul>
  <li><b>TinyPointNet</b>: this model, based on PointNet, learns 3D descriptors from sampled point clouds. </li>
  <li><b>VoxelNet</b>: this model, based on VoxelNet, learns how to classify objects represented as voxel grids. </li>
</ul>
